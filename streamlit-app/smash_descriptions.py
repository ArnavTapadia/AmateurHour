            "The player is in mid-air, preparing to execute a jump smash. "
            "The racket arm is drawn back with the elbow positioned high, and the non-racket arm is slightly raised for balance. "
            "The body is rotating, and the player's eyes are likely tracking the shuttle. "
            "The elbow is positioned correctly behind the body, allowing for a full extension during the smash. "
            "The torso rotation generates more power, transferring energy from the core to the racket. "
            "The player has jumped, allowing for a steep downward smash trajectory, which makes the shot harder to return."

            "The player is now in the process of striking the shuttle. "
            "His body is fully rotated, and his hitting arm is in motion, about to make contact with the shuttle. "
            "His core and legs are engaged to generate maximum power. "
            "The full-body rotation increases power and speed. "
            "The playerâ€™s feet are still off the ground, meaning the smash will have a steep angle, making it harder for the opponent to defend. "
            "His non-racket arm is tucked in, maintaining balance and preventing excess movement."

            "His body is slightly leaning forward, indicating good weight transfer. "
            "The wrist snap adds extra speed to the smash, increasing its effectiveness. "
            "The forward body movement ensures momentum is transferred into the shot. "
