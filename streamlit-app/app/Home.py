This is a professional badminton player executing a perfect smash. Key points:
1. **Racket Preparation**: The racket is fully behind the head, with the elbow high.
2. **Body Rotation**: The player's body is turned sideways, using the core to generate power.
3. **Jump & Contact Point**: The shuttle is hit at the highest point, ensuring a steep angle.
4. **Follow-Through**: The arm fully extends after contact for maximum power.

A proper smash uses core strength, wrist snap, and fast recovery positioning.
